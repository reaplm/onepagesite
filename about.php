			I am a server-side developer from Botswana. 
			I currently work as an analyst programmer in Gaborone. I graduated with an 
			engineering degree from Monash University in 2009 and now work a developer 
			for a government organization, a position I earned through hard work and
			persistence. I have consistently demonstrated innovation and dedication 
			throughout my career and this is what has set me apart from everyone else 
			I have worked with. I regularly take on challenging projects as I see 
			this as a learning opportunity and the chance to increase my skill set. I
			am seeking opportunities that offer career growth while also giving me the 
			opportunity to explore areas that will expose me to new techniques and ideas 
			that I can use to advance my career.
